# Weather-app
This is project just to remind some gitflow and to get back into react momentum.

Simple weather app which just fetches the data from openweathermap.com API, and shows it on the page.
With the button for now but probably I'll make it onChange later what will give an effect which will be look like a live searching.
Simply just by adding it into a ComponentDidMount lifecycle.
